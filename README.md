### Binary Beatz

The focus of this game is to help players learn the foundational building
blocks of computational systems, The binary numbering system and
basic binary arithmetic. The game is inspired by the drum machines and
rhythm generators that are prevalent in the music industry since the
late 80â€™s, and adds a musical beat to the binary digits that the player
encounters within the game.
